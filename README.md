# VBA-challenge

This folder contains my VBA code (BAS) file and three screen shots of the stocks for 2016 - 2014.

VBA Code File:
    Cycles through all of the stock data and compiles in a single row a tickers yearly change, percentage change, and volume. The VBA script than formats the yearly change to show if the stock grew (positive = green) or ended with a loss (negative = red)
